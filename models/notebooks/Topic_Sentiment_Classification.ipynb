Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip! \n",

Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort. \n",

Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco.

Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet.

      "Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits. \n",

      "My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai. \n",

But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.

Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much. \n",

      "We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay. \n",

      "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \n",
      "I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience. \n",

      "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning. \n",

      "NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once. \n",

      "They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said \"oh that's only Pepsi\".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.  \n",
      "We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.  \n",
      "It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.  \n",
      "When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.  \n",

      "We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.\n",

We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time. \n",

      "It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back. \n",

      "I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best. \n",

      "My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here. \n",

      "However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead.

      "The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n",
      "\n",
      "But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed. \n",

      "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while. \n",
      "\n",

      "The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide. \n",
      "\n",
      "I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do.

      "\n",
      "This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. \n",
      "\n",
      "More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. \n",

When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.\n",

      "\n",
      "My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta! \n",
      "\n",
      "We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.

It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees. \n",
      "\n",
      "I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "- We were staying a nearby hotel.\n",
      "- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.\n",
      "- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.\n",
      "- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!\n",
      "- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.\n",
      "- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...\n",
      "- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. \n",
      "- Clean the bathroom!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos! \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever! \n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!! \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?) \n",
      "\n",
      "Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up! \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast! \n",
      "\n",
      "I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA! \n",
      "\n",
      "A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled! \n",
      "\n",
      "Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience... \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog. \n",
